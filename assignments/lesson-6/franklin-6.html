            Franklin broke a new record for maximum wind speeds in the area on May 24, 2017. Previous maximum wind speeds for the town were recorded on April 28, 1984, and measured at 89 mph. On Thursday, the wind speed topped out at 92 mph. Even with warning by local weather stations to be prepare properties and outside items for high winds, the residents of Franklin still face a large-scale recovery project.
          </p>
          <p>
            While no people were injured in the wind storm, the Fish and Game Department responded to several reports of injured wildlife in the area. A small moose was trapped under several downed trees and was extricated. Several other dear had received injuries and were unable to walk well. They are currently being cared for by the local zoo and will be released back into the wild once they have recuperated.
          </p>
          <p>Numerous homes and vehicles were damaged in town by downed trees. Power was cutoff for the east side residents due to snapped power lines. The are of Hyde Park was hit particularly hard with downed trees and several are blocking roads. Officials have asked the community to please stay clear of the area unless you live nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are interested in volunteering to help with cleanup or injured animals, please contact Zoe with the local Red Cross at (218) 358-9385.
